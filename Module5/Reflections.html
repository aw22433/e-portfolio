									<h3>Final Reflections</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Prior to starting this module, I had done very little academic writing since my undergraduate degree 10 years ago. While I have had some practice during this postgraduate degree, I felt that my research and academic writing skills needed to improve before commencing the final MSc project. I believed that the literature review and research proposal assignments within this module would be challenging, but also worthwhile and would refine the skills required for the final project. Aside from the academic writing and research skills, I also felt that my knowledge of the various methods of data collection and analysis needed to improve. Looking ahead to the worksheets in Unit 8, I felt a little overwhelmed as this is not a subject I had studied before. However, I was keen to get started and improve my research and academic skills. </p>
								<p>In Unit 1 I selected the subject for the literature review, which I decided should be within the medical devices field, since this is a topic in which I already have knowledge and will be relevant to my MSc project. I found the required reading in unit 2 a particularly helpful resource in understanding what was required for the assignments in this module. This reading was a reminder of the complexities of academic research. The lecturecast was also useful in starting to consider what research questions I could investigate for the upcoming assignments. I decided to keep the literature review as broad as possible within the subject field, in the hopes of finding suitable research questions for the later assignments. As I worked through units 4, 5 and 6 I gained more confidence with the various research methods which could come in useful for my research proposal. </p>
								<p>By unit 7, I had completed my literature review, however, my time management for this assignment was up to my usual standard and I felt my final submission was not as good as I could have produced. This was fairly reflected in the grade I received, and while I was disappointed with my result, I used this as a learning opportunity and a reminder to set aside more time for future assignments. Upon reflection of this assignment and taking on the feedback I received, I believe there were several areas I could have improved for this assignment. First, there were sections of the review which could have been more detailed, and some areas which I did not mention at all. One suggestion from the feedback which I found particularly helpful was that I should have referred to more specific research questions within the literature review. I agree that this would have given my review more focus and structure. This is something I will keep in mind for the MSc project. </p>
								<p>Unit 8 introduced me to Inferential statistics which is a subject I have not studied before. I found the worksheet to be quite challenging, however the required reading for this week was very helpful in completing these exercises. As I worked through these exercises, and continued reading the relevant eBook, I felt my confidence in this subject growing. This is an area which I hope to continue improving on and have taken this into consideration with my action plan going forward. Furthermore, I believe this will be a very useful skill to utilise during the MSc project. </p>
								<p>I began working on the research proposal presentation. I decided to select the same topic as the literature review, focusing on a research question that had arisen from my research of this topic. I decided to create a proposal to investigate barriers to the approval and implementation of new machine learning tools within the medical diagnostics field. This is a topic that I have an interest in, is related to my current career and could prove valuable to the industry. Furthermore, I felt this would be a challenge because in previous projects that I have undertaken, I have always focused on the gathering and analysis of quantitative data. Qualitative data analysis is not something that I am experienced with, and I have not used methods such as interviews or surveys before. However, I felt by selecting this subject, it would give me a challenge and an opportunity to learn more about these methodologies. Unit 5 was a very useful resource in designing the research methodology for my proposal. Unit 9 focused on analysing Qualitative data, which also proved very useful. </p>
								<p>The result for my research proposal presentation was much better than the previous assignment, however I still felt there were areas which I could have improved. On the positive side, I felt my time management was much better for this assignment, and I was able to dedicate the time to complete this assignment properly. Upon reading the feedback and reflecting on my submission, one area which I believe I could improve on was the methodology. In particular, I feel that I should have used more of the knowledge I picked up during Unit 9 to create a more detailed description of how I would analyse the data and how it could be presented. This is something I will improve on for the MSc proposal. Other issues noted in the feedback was the low audio quality and that the presentation was not engaging enough. The audio quality will be easily fixed for future assignments. In order to make future presentations more engaging I will look to improve my presentation skills. Again, I have added this to my action plan to focus on improving these skills.</p>
								<p>Overall, I feel that this module has been very valuable in preparing me for the MSc project and I now feel more prepared to continue to this project. I have refined my research and academic skills while learning more about various methodologies, quantitative and qualitative analysis. This module has also helped me to identify key areas of improvement which I can focus on as I continue my studies. </p>
