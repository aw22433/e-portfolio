										<h3>Unit 1:</h3>
									</header>
									<pre>
										This was the first week of the new module. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the first 
										seminar however upon catching up I found that all 5 of the participants on this course were 
										in the same group. We created a WhatsApp group and agreed to meet on the Sunday at 11am. 
										During this meeting we:</pre>
									<li>Set up slack and Trello groups </li>
									<li>Set up a google drive to store and work on all documents together</li>
									<li>Set up separate GitHub repositories for the design and coding outputs of our upcoming projects. Each GitHub repository contained separate branches for me and each of my peers. </li>
									<li>Initially agreed that we all preferred the Dutch Police option for our project. </li>
									<li>Agreed to use the Django Framework to create our project.</li>
									<li>Completed the team contract</li>
									<pre>As we left the meeting we all agreed to brainstorm and present our ideas at the next meeting. </pre>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 2:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>During the meeting this week, Etkin and I both had ideas for our upcoming project. Our ideas were somewhat similar, his idea being that members of the public could report cybersecurity attacks, and my idea being that members of the public could report vulnerabilities on government websites. We agreed to compromise and bring both ideas together where possible. The next task was to begin working on our UML diagrams. We all agreed that if we each picked a UML diagram and worked on these separately, there was a strong chance the diagrams would not be compatible and there was a strong risk of silo working. Ultimately, it would waste everyoneâ€™s limited time and we would then have to compromise on which diagrams to use. Instead, we agreed that Mustafa would work on the Use case diagram. This made sense as the first diagram to produce because if we had an agreed use case diagram, we could each build from that and our individual work would be compatible. </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 3</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This week we discussed the Use case diagram that Mustafa had produced. As a group, we collaboratively made changes and improvements to the diagram until everyone was happy with it. We then agreed that for next weeks meeting, we would bring together our ideas for the Class diagram, identifying which classes to include. Etkin contributed significantly to this stage with some great ideas. </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 4</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This week we collaboratively completed the Class diagram and made some further changes to the Use case diagram. It was a particularly long meeting with everyone contributing to finalise our diagrams.  </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 5</h3>
									</header>
									<p> This week Ola had prepared an Activity diagram for the general public users. As a group we reproduced and improved this diagram quite significantly, as although the underlying information was mostly present, the diagram was not formatted correctly and contained multiple activities. When we were happy with this diagram, we agreed that we would ask for feedback to ensure this was up to the required standard.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 6</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This week I brought together the work we had produced so far into a template for the final document. We had done a significant amount of work across multiple different documents; however we had not brought everything together under a final document which we could submit next week. We also worked on a second Activity diagram following feedback we received. This Activity diagram focused on the operator view. We collaboratively worked on the final document and had a final meeting prior to submitting the final design proposal. This was another long meeting where we ensured everyone was happy with the outcome of our proposal.</p>
									<p>You can see the final document below:</p>

										<h3>Unit 7</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We rearranged this weeks meeting from Sunday to the following Tuesday. </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 8</h3>
									</header>
									<p> Having submitted our design proposal, we now had to begin coding our project. We started by listing the pages that our website would require. We distributed the tasks between us as follows:</p>
									<li>Aaron: Operator view</li>
									<li>Etkin: General Public view</li>
									<li>Gianluca: Homepage</li>
									<li>Mustafa: Password control </li>
									<li>Ola: Overall design</li>
									<p>We agreed to  complete our designs by the end of this week, then begin coding next week.</p>
									<p>We met again on Sunday, and Etkin had already completed most of the coding for his section. Gianluca had also made significant progress with the design of the homepage. I had made good progress with my design. </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 9</h3>
									</header>
									<p>By the end of Unit 9, I had made significant progress in creating the operator view pages. Although it was still very basic in terms of functionality, I was slowly building the page up to a good standard. One issue we did come across was that myself and Etkin had both separately created models for our individual pages. We were each unable to code our pages up to this point without creating these models. Although both models were very similar, mine contained several additional fields which were essential to the operator view. Etkin and I stayed after the meeting and agreed we would use his model. We then amended his model to be compatible with mine and I amended my code so it could use his model. This was significantly easier than expected and we quickly had it working with both of our pages. During this meeting we also merged all of our work with the homepage so we finally had a functioning, yet unfinished, website. During this week, Gianluca had also made significant progress with the Admin pages and had continued working on the overall design.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 10</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Once again, this week we presented the progress that we had each made. I had added more functionality to my pages, including adding search bars, CRUD capabilities and the ability to update. I had also added some design to my page. Unfortunately, Gianluca had also been working on redesigning the operator pages cosmetically and there were significant merge conflicts. We compromised and stuck with my branch version due to the functionality improvements I had made, however we agreed to use some of his cosmetic design rather than mine. Meanwhile, Mustafa had been making good progress with the Account control measures.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 11</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This week we again met to update everyone on our ongoing work. I had almost finished my section of the website, as had Etkin. Gianluca was continuing to make small improvements to the design. We agreed that Mustafa would work on the threading and uploading of the website. Ola agreed to perform some testing on the website.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Unit 12</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We held a final meeting to complete our final merge, upload the final version, collaboratively complete the readme file and check for any final bugs or issues with the website.  </p>
									<p>Please see our final version below:</p>
