									<h1>Final Reflections </h1>
								</header>
								<p>This module was the most challenging module I have met so far during my studies on this course. Every week brought a new challenge, with difficult course content, a fast pace and most challenging for me, an opportunity to work collaboratively with my peers on the group project. Collaborative working is a crucial skill in almost any computer science field but particularly in any programming team within industry. There were several challenges which arose for me during the course of the group project, and while each of my colleagues were enthusiastic, helpful and very knowledgeable, there were many areas where I felt I needed to improve. </p>
								<p>One such challenge was the fact that we, as a group, decided to use Django to build this project. At least three out of the five of us had never used Django before and were therefore faced with the prospect of learning a new framework, on top of the course content, with looming deadlines and other commitments. While I may not have chosen this path had I been working on my own during this project, I benefitted significantly from being put in a position to learn this framework under pressure. Not only have I gained new skills, but it has also significantly improved my confidence with programming in general and my ability to learn. Furthermore, I believe the resulting project was significantly more successful due to our use of this framework as it was the most suitable framework for this task. It provided us with the tools to create a good, secure, clean website with all of the functionality we required. This new skill was thoroughly tested when I was assigned the task of designing and coding the operator pages, which really stretched my skillset and kept me learning and improving my skills right through the project. I now feel comfortable using Django, and would be confident to use it in any future projects. </p>
								<p>I was initially very intimidated by the group project, aside from the size and volume of work, I was aware that several of my peers were significantly more experienced than I was, and I had never worked collaboratively within a team in this kind of project. I wasnâ€™t sure how we could all programme a website collaboratively, even with a modular design and tools such as GitHub. Furthermore, I was concerned that with my limited skills, particularly in Django, I would not get the opportunity to contribute as much as I would like. However, with the assistance of my peers, we quickly established our roles in the team and fairly distributed the work. Despite different levels of experience, I was able to significantly contribute to this project. I can now confidently say that I could contribute to future projects regardless of experience level. </p>
								<p>Another significant challenge I found was having to compromise with my peers. I have not done group projects such as this in a long time. Initially I felt protective over my area of work, as I had put a lot of effort in and was committed to continuously improve it. During one of the final weeks, one of my peers made some cosmetic changes to the same page as I had been working on due to a small breakdown in communication and we both came up with conflicting designs. This caused a merge error when we tried to merge everything together. Initially I felt like I had wasted my time however, I quickly saw the benefits of this event. First, it reminded me of the importance of clear communication. Had we communicated a little bit more, we could have avoided this merge conflict and adopted both designs. Second, this is a team project, and although I had started working on an area, it does not belong to me and is all our responsibility. Ultimately, we quickly corrected the merge errors and compromised to create a final output that we were all happy with. This was a very minor event however the lessons I learned made it a significant event in my learning journey during this module.</p>
								<p>Despite the challenges, I have found this the most rewarding of the projects I have completed in my studies. I have learned a lot from my peers, both practically in terms of the code, but also how to compromise, communicate and support others. It was also fantastic to get to know each other and to have that network to support other areas of the course. </p>
